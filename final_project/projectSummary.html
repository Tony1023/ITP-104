    My final project serves as the starting point (well, actually it's about half done already) as my personal website, to display my info and demo my projects.

    The graphics I used are pretty much programming-related (as you can see from the logo and the background image).

    I did not use 3rd party plug-ins. The special features I used are: custom fonts, embedded Youtube Video, and responsive design (though both are for computers).

    I did not bother to style this page. Please pardon me, lol.
