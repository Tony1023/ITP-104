      <h1>Stellar Body Motion Simulator</h1>
      <h3>Swift/iOS</h3>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This is an iOS application whose primary function is a simulator of stellar body motion in three-dimentional space due to gravity. For the time being, the stars are set to identical.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play with it, you can rotate the view angle and add new bodies into the simulator, or you can go to the auto replay simulator which automatically restarts a random simulation whenever it detects an ejected star. Feel free to just let it run and find your own stable solution for the three body problem!
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a set of preset initial states you start the simulation with. In the future, it will be possible to store your own discovered state.
      </p>
			<p>
				The project is not deployed onto app store and its feature is still being enrished, but people could download the <a href="https://github.com/Tony1023/Three-Body" target="_blank">source code</a> and run it locally.
