      <h1>Stellar Body Motion Simulator</h1>
      <h3>Swift/iOS</h3>
		</header>

		<section class="proj-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This is an iOS application whose primary function is a simulator of stellar body motion in three-dimentional space due to gravity. For the time being, the stars are set to identical.
      </p>
      <p>
        To play with it, you can rotate the view angle and add new bodies into the simulator, or you can go to the auto replay simulator which automatically restarts a random simulation whenever it detects an ejected star. Feel free to just let it run and find your own stable solution for the three body problem!
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a set of preset initial states you start the simulation with. In the future, it will be possible to store your own discovered state.
      </p>
			<p>
				The project is not deployed onto app store and its feature is still being enrished, but people could download the <a href="https://github.com/Tony1023/Three-Body" target="_blank">source code</a> and run it locally.

      <h2>Some Techincal Details...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Multithreading: animation (updating the display at 60 fps) and simulation (computing acceleration, velocity, and position) are on different threads, which immensely increases the efficiency of the program.</li>
        <li>Multiple MVC: enable user selection of inital states and different versions of simulator.</li>
        <li>Inheritance: it felt risky to simply use inheritance for the auto-restart simulator from the generic one. Its functionalities are very similar to that of the generic one, but still some distinctions exist. Also, there are a lot of gesture recognizers which made the issue more complicated. But things turned out pretty well.</li>
        <li>Timer: the replay count-down is realized using iOS's timer.</li>
        <li>Linear algebra/rotation matrices: I proudly applied a piece of textbook knowledge to the engineering of software. The rotation of view angles is enabled by 3D rotation matrices, by multiplying new rotations to the previous coordinates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Hope that you've heard about the novel, Three Body, by a Chinese writer, Cixin Liu. The original name of the project was named after that. Although I changed the name afterwards, the repository on Github is still named "Three-Body."
      </p>
      <p>
        Three Body tells an amazing story about the aliens living in a three-star system trying to invade the Earth. They are unable to predict the stars movements (actually which is mathematically impossible for the time being) and thus always face the danger of extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I was motivated to make such a simulator for myself to look for a stable solution not in the set of known ones. It's quite ambitious but this project is not that impossible. And it turned out very fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, the novel is nothing like the classical (or mediocre) sci-fi about alien invasion. Really, give it a try! Personally, I think the second of the three-book series is the most fantastic one.
