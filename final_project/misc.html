			<p>
				As the official sequel of Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is one of my main entertainment. I play every weekend with another four teammates. Skillwise, I'm not in the elite level, but I enjoy the fun more than just winning.
			</p>
			<p>
				Professional scenes are an essential part of this game. There are many clubs and organizations all around the world (most organizations have CS:GO branches as well as others like DOTA2 or Overwatch). Throughout the year, around 15 large events are held, including two "Major" sponsered by Valve themselves. I would watch most of them if time allows.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's the highlights of my favorite player -- Aleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev two years ago when he won a championship and earned the MVP award.

			<h2>Basketball</h2>
			<p>
				Yes, I also watch NBA and play basketball occasionally. The logo of my favorite team is to the right. Wish them good luck in the incoming playoff series!
