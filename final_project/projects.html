			<h2>Stellar Body Motion Simulator</h2>
			<p>
				This is an iOS application whose primary function is a simulator of stellar body motion in 3D space due to gravity. For the time being, the stars are set to identical. A user can rotate the view angle and add new celestial bodies into the simulator, or the user can go to the auto-replay simulator which automatically restarts a random simulation whenever it detects an ejected star.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project is not deployed onto app store and its feature is still being enrished, but you could download the <a href="https://github.com/Tony1023/Three-Body" target="_blank">source code</a> and run it locally.
